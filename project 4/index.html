    <h1>REDUCED SNOWFALL</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>For two consecutive winters, Jammu and Kashmir has seen much lower than normal snowfall, especially across
            the main
            valleys. Lawmakers have even talked about this issue in the assembly because it’s affecting water supplies
            and local
            life</li>
        <li>there was over 50% snowfall deficit record</li>
        <li>warmer, erratic winters — with less snow</li>
        <li>During the traditional 40-day peak winter period (Chilai Kalan) Kashmir saw nearly no snowfall and a ~96%
            deficit in
            precipitation over several districts a huge change from normal patterns</li>

    </ul>
    <p>This drastic change in climate is paying way to scarcity of water and a huge loss in economy of kashmir</p>
    <p>there was only a light snowfall seen in the city area like SRINAGAR</p>
